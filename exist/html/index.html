      Welcome to the public API of the <em>Beethoven in the House</em> project,
      which is a collaborative research projectâ€¦
    </p>
    <p>
      This domain is intended as an API endpoint, there is no website content available over here. A good starting point to use this API is the following endpoint: <a href="https://api.domestic-beethoven.eu/iiif/documents.json" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://api.domestic-beethoven.eu/iiif/documents.json</a>. A more complete OpenAPI documentation of this API will be added at a later stage of the project. While we're aiming at stable references for use in a Linked Data context, we cannot ensure persistent identifiers (or content) at this point yet, so please consider all contents as temporary for now. 
    </p>
